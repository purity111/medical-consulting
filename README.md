# Hayat Hospital Management System

### Background

Todayâ€™s medical diagnoses are a critical part of our patient experience, problems related to getting a
diagnosis from multiple hospitals are documented as diagnosis history, for example, currently if a patient
moves from one hospital to another, they need to describe the whole problem they are facing again to the
new doctor while showing the radiological image and orally speak out what previous doctors diagnoses
where. Furthermore, privacy breaches happen when an unauthorized entity accesses the printed or digital
patient diagnosis of radiological images resulting in a risk of patient data misuse or exploitation.

### Aim

Our project aims to revolutionize healthcare by creating a hospital management system that will implement
techniques to securely incorporate patient medical records with radiological images. This will allow for
integration between radiological images and patient records along with the ability to track medical
diagnoses easily, with the goal of creating a secure and comprehensive healthcare system that facilitates
better patient monitoring and diagnosis, ultimately creating a more efficient and secure hospital
management system.

### High level system architecture

## Technology Stack

1. **Frontend**:
   - **React**: For building the interactive and dynamic user interface.
   - **TailwindCSS**: For responsive and customizable UI styling.
2. **Backend**:
   - **Node.js** and **Nest.js**: For creating the backend RESTful API and server-side logic.
   - **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database to store user information, medical records, and other system data.
   - **Mongoose**: An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library to interact with MongoDB.
3. **Real-time Communication**:
   - **Socket.io**: Used to implement an Online/Offline feature for doctors. Doctors can be considered Online if available for consultations or Offline if unavailable (during consultations or logged out).
   - **WebRTC & PeerJS**: For enabling video consultations. WebRTC handles the media transfer, while PeerJS is used for establishing peer-to-peer connections.
